# Dysarthria automatic detection --- Audio processing and indexing project
Dysarthric Speech Detection Using Model-Based Methods
Introduction
Speech disorders, also known as speech impairments, are communication disorders characterized by disruptions in normal speech production. These disruptions can manifest as difficulties in forming clear, intelligible speech sounds. Conditions such as dysarthria, apraxia, aphasia, dyslexia, and degenerative diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s are categorized as speech disorders. These issues can arise from various causes, including strokes, accidents, or congenital defects.

Dysarthria, a specific type of speech disorder, is caused by muscle weakness resulting from defects or damage in the nervous system. It typically manifests as mumbled or slurred speech, making communication particularly challenging for affected individuals. Addressing dysarthria and other speech disorders is crucial for improving quality of life and communication ability.

Objective
This project explores model-based methods to distinguish dysarthric speech from normal speech with high accuracy. It focuses on leveraging advanced machine learning models, including baseline logistic regression and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect and analyze speech impairments.

Features
Speech Dataset Analysis: Utilizes datasets that include samples of dysarthric and normal speech.
Model Comparisons: Implements and compares multiple machine learning models for speech disorder detection.
Advancements in Speech Technology: Explores the integration of innovative tools to address critical challenges in speech impairment detection and treatment.
Methodology
The methodology for this project involves the following:

Data Collection: Using a balanced dataset of normal and dysarthric speech samples.
Model Design: Developing baseline and advanced machine learning models, including logistic regression and CNNs.
Training and Testing: Training models on speech datasets and evaluating their performance to distinguish between normal and dysarthric speech.
